# TW Graceful Shutdown

![Apache 2](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/l/plug.svg)

This will keep your service running and kicking, until all the clients have understood that the node is going to shut down. 
It will make sure that all on-flight requests will get served, all the jobs will gracefully shut down, all kafka listeners will stop and so on and on.

The benefits are - less errors for clients, but also cleaner monitoring.

## How it works

##### When application has started:

1. It calls `applicationStarted` for each `GracefulShutdownStrategy`.

##### When application is stopped:

1. GracefulShutdowner receives a stop notification.
2. It calls `prepareForShutdown` for each `GracefulShutdownStrategy`
3. Waits for [30 secs](core/src/main/java/com/transferwise/common/gracefulshutdown/config/GracefulShutdownProperties.java) so that all clients understand that they should not call this application node anymore.
4. Waits until all strategies return true in the `canShutdown` method.

[Here](core/src/main/java/com/transferwise/common/gracefulshutdown/strategies) is the list of default `GracefulShutdownStrategy` implementations. 

You can add your own by just creating a bean that implements `GracefulShutdownStrategy`.
