## About
This will keep your service running and kicking, until all the clients have understood that the node is going to shut down. 
It will make sure that all on-flight requests will get served, all the jobs will gracefully shut down, all kafka listeners will stop and so on and on.

The benefits are - fewer errors for clients, but also cleaner monitoring.
